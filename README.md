# mateu-cms

Yes, this will be a CMS (content management system).

It must have the following features:

- multiple users per account
- different roles (publisher, author)
- as many websites as you want per account
- you will be able to duplicate and remove websites
- version control
- publishing workflow
- server technology aware (by using rest web services)
- wysiwyg editor
- several base templates
- add your own components

Here I will put the JPA entities.

I still have to decide if I will use Eclipselink or Openjpa. I will see...

Have a nice day ;)
